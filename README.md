Hello world!
Welcome to the hello-world repository for Week 15 Lab 1 in CS 3377.0W1.

### About Me

I'm Annie Agnew, a student at UTD. My major is computer science and I'm creating this for CS 3377.
I love listening to music while reading a good book in the company of my pets. I also enjoy cooking, hiking and fishkeeping.
